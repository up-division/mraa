UP Squared Pro Board   {#up2_6000}
================================
UP Squared is based on the Intel&reg; Atom(R)&trade; x6000 series formerly ElkhartLake&trade;.

For the full specification please refer to the main specification page here:

https://up-board.org/up-squared-6000/

Interface notes
-----------------------
The Up Squared present one Raspberry Pi compatible HAT connector and a  60 pin exHAT connector. Currently this implementation only support the interfaces through the HAT connector.

**I2C**
 - 3 channels (1 of 3 is in the carrier board)
 - Support: standard-mode (100kHz), fast-mode (400kHz), Fast-mode plus (1MHz), High-speed mode (3.4MHz)
 - Bus frequency can be selected in BIOS settings
 - The default i2c channel is the one connected to the pin 3,5 of the hat
 - On some OSes the i2c-dev kernel module may need to be loaded manually to export the i2c device nodes

**SPI**
 - Bus frequencies up to 10MHz are supported
 - 3 chip-selects
 - To enable SPI device nodes the ACPI tables need to be overwritten as explained [here](https://wiki.up-community.org/Pinout_UP2#SPI_Ports)

**PWM**
 - Up to 6 channel of PWM (4 of 6 are in the carrier board)

**UART**
 - 1 high-speed UART is available
 - Supporting baud rates up to 3686400 baud
 - Hardware flow-control signals are available on pins 11/36 (RTS/CTS)

Please note that a kernel with UP board support is required to enable the I/O
interfaces above.

Pin Mapping
--------------------
The GPIO numbering in the following pin mapping is based on the Raspberry Pi
model 2 and B+ numbering scheme.

NOTE: the i2c device numbering depend on various factor and cannot be trusted:
the right way of determining i2c (and other devices) numbering is through PCI
physical device names. See the source code in src/x86/up2_6000.c for details.
